To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).

# Run with Docker

`docker build -t alloverse_dashboard .`

And then

`docker run --publish 4000:4000 --env DATABASE_URL=ecto://user:pass@<my_ip>/db_name --env SECRET_KEY_BASE="somethingSecret" --rm -it alloverse_dashboard`

## Using local database on Mac

You need to have a postgres server installed on your computer. If you have a Mac, you can:

* brew install postgresql
* brew services start postgresql
* /usr/local/opt/postgres/bin/createuser -s postgres
* ... and THEN do the ecto setup etc from above.

If you're running from docker, you need to allow outside access:

Replace listen with listen = "*" in this file

`sudo pico /usr/local/var/postgres/postgresql.conf`

Add your ip address and trust in this file

`sudo pico /usr/local/var/postgres/pg_hba.conf`

Then restart postgress like this

`brew services restart postgres`
